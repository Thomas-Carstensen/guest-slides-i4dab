### Intro

#### Relational Model

![The Moment](./img/theMoment.jpg "The Moment")

----

### Agenda

* Database
* Relational model
* SQL (more in week 2, 3, and 4)
* Modeling
* Process
* Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD)

---

### Database

* Database is an abstraction on a filesystem, which allow common operations on data
* Database server
    * Allows multiple simultaneous clients to do:
        * **C**reate **R**ead **U**pdate and **D**elete operations: AKA **CRUD**
    * Access over network
    * Can be spread on multiple hosts
    * And maybe the most important topic: allow data oriented access to the file/files

----

### Database server

* Where and when is it running
* SQL Server:
    * when the docker container is running
    * when windows server is running
    * when localDB is running
* SQLite:
    * when the sqlite.exe is executing
* MongoDb:
    * when the docker container is running
    * when windows services running
    * when mongodb.exe is executing

----

### Data model 

* Structure of the data
    * Operations on the data
    * Queries and modifications
* Constraints on the data

----

#### Data Model In Our Context 1

* Do we already know something?
    * Yes, because we are doing domain models and class models when doing OO-A and -D
    * To construct a database we need a data model looking for entities
    * Diffence between object and entity? In short! Object = data + behavior; Entity = data; (a definiton to start with!!)

----

#### Data Model In Our Context 2

* Automatization
    * For a relational database, this model is very often a Entity Relationship Diagram model (ERD model)
    * In a ERD model we identifies entities and their relationships, ie nouns and verbs in user stories/use cases
    * For all relationships, AKA associations, we identify their degree, connectivity and exsistience


----

#### Data Model In Our Context 3

* Automatization
    * When we have a ERD model we know exactly how to construct the database with tables and relationships
    * Ten design rules transforms the ERD model to a relational database (rdb) schema
    * Giving the possibillities to let db-tools convert an ERD to a rdb schema
    * But as you will se later on, the same goes for an OO class model, it can be converted to a rdb schema

----

### Data model

* Relational model vs semi-structured model
* Values
* Objects

```xml
<Movies>
  <Movie title="Star Wars"><Year>1977</Year><Length>124</Length><Genre>SciFi</Genre></Movie>
  <Movie title="Ghost"><Year>1990</Year><Length>127</Length><Genre>Drama</Genre></Movie>
  <Movie title="Skyfall"><Year>2012</Year><Length>143</Length><Genre>Action</Genre></Movie>
</Movies>
```
<!-- .element: style="font-size: 12px" -->

```javascript
[
    { title: "Star Wars", year: 1977, length: 124, genre: "SciFy"}, 
    { title: "Ghost", year: 1990, length: 127, genre: "Drama"}, 
    { title: "Skyfall", year: 2012, length: 143, genre: "Action"}, 
]
```
<!-- .element: style="font-size: 12px" -->

----

### Structured data


| Title     | Year | Length | Genre  |
|-----------|------|--------|--------|
| Star Wars | 1977 | 124    | SciFy  |
| Ghost     | 1990 | 127    | Drama  |
| Skyfall   | 2012 | 143    | Action |


---

## Relational model

"Data dominates. If you've chosen the
right data structures and organized
things well, the algorithms will almost
always be self-evident. Data structures,
not algorithms, are central to
programming." - Rob Pike in 1989

----

### Basic

* Relation (Two-dimensional table)
    * Row represent an entity (object)
    * Column represent an attribute (property)
* Attributes
    * Must be **atomic**, eg. int, string, ...
* Schema
* Tuples

| Title     | Year | Length | Genre  |
|-----------|------|--------|--------|
| Star Wars | 1977 | 124    | SciFy  |
| Ghost     | 1990 | 127    | Drama  |
| Skyfall   | 2012 | 143    | Action |
<!-- .element: class="fragment" style="font-size: 22px" -->

----

### Representation of Relations
* Relations are Set\<Tuple\>
    * Order of rows and columns are not significant
* Relations are not static
    * Addition, modifications, deletion
    * Less common, changes to schema


----

### Keys

* Fundamental constraint
* A set of attributes forms a key iff. we do not allow two tuples to have the same values in all key attributes
    * Eg. Movies(title, year, length, genre)
* Keys can be generated
* Key constraints is a statement for all possible instances of the relation

----

### Schema

```sql
Movies (
  title: string, year: integer, length: integer, genre: string, studioName: string
)
MovieStar (
  name: string, address: string, gender: char
)
Studio (
  name: string, address: string, pressC: integer
)
```

----

### Sql

* Data-Definition sub-language
    * Declaring database structures
    * Declaring database constraints
* Data-Manipulation sub-language
    * Querying database for content
    * Modifying database content

```sql
CREATE TABLE
Movies (
  title CHAR(100),
  year INT,
  length INT,
  genre CHAR(20)
)
---
SELECT title FROM Movies ORDER BY year
```

----

### Relations in SQL

* Stored relations
    * Tables
    * Views
        * Relations defined by computation
        * Not stored but constructed when needed
    * Temporary tables
        * Constructed by SQL processor
        * Constructed as part of queries and data modification
        * Thrown away after

---

## Simple table definition

"Fold knowledge into data, so program
logic can be stupid and robust." - Eric Raymond

----

### Data types

* Strings: char(n) and varchar(n)
* Unicode: nchar(n) and nvarchar(n)
* Bit: bit(n)
* Boolean: bit(1)
* Numbers: int, bigint, smallint
* Floating point numbers: float, real
* Time: date, datetime2, datetimeoffset

**Note**: Differs from SQL engine to engine.

----

```sql
CREATE TABLE Movies (
    title CHAR(100), year INT, length INT, genre CHAR(20)
)
SELECT title FROM Movies ORDER BY year
ALTER TABLE Movies ADD studioName CHAR(30)
DROP TABLE Movies
CREATE TABLE Movies (
  title CHAR(100), year INT, length INT, genre CHAR(20),
  CONSTRAINT key_title_year_uniquey UNIQUE (title, year)
)
DROP TABLE Movies
CREATE TABLE Movies (
  title CHAR(100), year INT, length INT,
  genre CHAR(20) DEFAULT 'UNKNOWN',
)
DROP TABLE Movies
```

## Modeling

#### Entity Relationship Diagram

![Modeling](./img/modeling.png "Modeling")

----

### Why

* Create model before system to avoid expensive changes
* Simplify real world problems to create a simple relational model
* Communicate design between developers and / or customer(s)

----

### What

* Domain rules and business rules
* Data structures and object structures
* Not processes

----

### How

* Design interaction between application and database
* Optional: Use an Object Relational Mapper

---

### Process

* Requirements
* Logical design
* Physical design

----

![Database design life cycle](./img/databaseLifeCycle.png "")<!-- .element: style="height:600px" -->

----

### Requirements

* From producers and consumers of data
* Must include
    *  Data
    * Relationship between data


![Logical Design](./img/logicalDesign.png "Logical Desing") <!-- .element: style="height:200px" -->

----

### Logical design (1/2)

* Schema showing all data and relationships between entities
* Can be done in Entity-Relationship (E/R) or Unified Modeling Language (UML)
* **Goal**: Model that can be transferred into database tables

----

### Logical design (2/2)

* Conceptual data modeling
    * Typically modeled by E/R and UML
    * Relationships, super-types etc.
* View integration
    * Normally necessary in large projects
    * Eliminate inconsistencies and redundancies
    * E.g. find synonyms, aggregate and generalize
* Transform to SQL (covered in week 2-3)
* Normalize tables

---

## Entity relationship diagrams
#### Chen notation

----

### Components

* Entities: principle data objects
    * Key uniquely identifies occurrence
* Weak entities
    * Connected to parent - cannot exists without
* Relationship
    * Associations between entities
* Attributes
    * Multivalued: Multiple values
    * Complex: Attribute contains more information

----

![ER components](./img/erComponents.png "ER Components") <!-- .element: style="height:600px" -->


----

### Relationship (1/3)

* No standard for connectivity
* One 2 one
    * Mapped with attributes
* One 2 many
    * Mapped with attributes
* Many 2 many
    * relationship table/connection entity - can have attributes associated
* Constraints on numbers (cardinality) are possible

----

![ER relationship connectivity](./img/erRelationshipConnectivity.png "ER relationship connectivity")<!-- .element: style="height:500px" -->


----

### Relationship (2/3)

* Binary
    * Most common
* Binary Recursive
    * Relationship between entities of same type
* Ternary - in a moment
* Higher degree
    * Not used

----

![ER Relationship degree](./img/erRelationshipDegree.png "ER relationship degree") <!-- .element: style="height:500px" -->

----

### Ternary relationship (1/4)

* **Should**  be used when binary relationships are not sufficient
* A 'one' relationship iff. one instance is associated with one of each of the two other
* else 'many'


----

### Ternary relationship (2/4)

* **Assertion 1**:
    * Relationship is one to one to one
    * Technician can work on multiple project - having different notebooks for each
![Tenary 1-1-1](./img/erTenaryOneOneOne.png "1-1-1")

----

### Ternary relationship (3/4)

* **Assertion 2**:
    * Employee works on one project in one location. Can be in different locations depending on project
    * At a location there can be multiple employees on a given project.

![Tenary 1-1-n](./img/erTenaryOneOneMany.png "1-1-n")

----

### Ternary relationship (4/4)

* **Assertion 3**:
    * A manager of a project manages multiple engineers
    * Manager of an engineer can manage multiple projects
    * Engineer working under a manager can work on multiple projects
![Tenary 1-b-n](./img/erTenaryOneManyMany.png "1-n-n")

----

### Relationship (3/3)

* Optional
    * Minimum of zero
* Mandatory
    * Minimum of one
* Existence is often inferred
    * E.g. weak entities can't have optional relationship to parent.

----

![ER Relationship exisitence](./img/erRelationshipExistence.png "ER Relationship exisitence") <!-- .element: style="height:300px" -->

----

### Generalization / Inheritence

* Disjoint
    * Requires mutually exclusiveness in sup-types
* Overlapping
    * Total or partial covered
    * Total -> double line

![ER Generalization](./img/erGeneralization.png "ER Generalization")  <!-- .element: style="float: right; height:300px" -->

----

### Aggregation

* Part-of relationship
* Seldom used
* No inherited attributes

![ER Aggregation](./img/erAggregation.png "ER Aggregation")  <!-- .element: style="float: right; height:200px" -->

----
